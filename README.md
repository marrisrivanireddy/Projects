## **Project Overview**
C-Square is a UI/UX prototype designed to enhance conference call experiences by displaying participant details. Often, during a conference call, users do not know who is on the call or how many people are present. C-Square solves this by visually representing all participants, showing their names if available, or displaying their phone numbers for unknown contacts.

## **Purpose**
- Provide a clear view of all participants in a conference call.
- Display names for saved contacts and phone numbers for unknown attendees.
- Improve user experience by offering transparency and ease of identification.

## **Features**
- **Conference Call Participant Display:** Shows all participants on the call.
- **Name Identification:** Displays names of known contacts.
- **Unknown Number Handling:** Shows phone numbers if contact details are unavailable.
- **User-Friendly Design:** A clean and intuitive UI designed for easy navigation.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Prototype Tool:** Figma
- **Design Approach:** User-centric, minimalistic, and accessible interface

## **How It Works**
1. When a user starts or joins a conference call, the interface updates to show all participants.
2. If a participant is a saved contact, their name appears.
3. If the participant is not saved, their phone number is displayed instead.
4. The user can view this information in real-time during the call.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with real-time calling applications.
- Option to add unknown numbers as contacts directly from the UI.
- Enhanced UI animations for better user experience.
